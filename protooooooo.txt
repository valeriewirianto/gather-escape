Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n
And sorry I could not travel both\n
And be one traveler, long I stood\n
And looked down one as far as I could\n
To where it bent in the undergrowth;\n

I shall be telling this with a sigh\n
Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—\n
I took the one less traveled by,\n
And that has made all the difference.\n

Congratulations! \n
Today is your day.\n
You're off to Great Places!\n
You're off and away!\n\n

You have brains in your head.\n
You have feet in your shoes.\n
You can steer yourself\n
any direction you choose.\n
You're on your own. And you know what you know.\n
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.\n

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\n
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;\n

I only love one, after every summer
