## Team Members

## Motivations
Just to experiment with the Gathertown API websocket and create a mini escape room out of it :) 

## Requirements

You must have node on your machine

## Running

`node game.js`

## Future Enhancements
A second escape room with more game mechanics aside from:
- password doors and chests
- pickupable items
- item locations in a room as an answer to a puzzle
